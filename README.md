# MLP-Handwritten-Digit-Only-NumPy

This assignment deals with implementing forward & back propagtion algorithm for MLP using only NumPy against any CNNs
Ouput was coded in one-hot encoding.
Stochastic gradient descent was implemented.

Network hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, neurons in hidden layer werr tuned - (Regularization was not used)
